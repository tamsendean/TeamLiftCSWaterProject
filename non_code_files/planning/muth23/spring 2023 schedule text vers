2/5-2/12: Specific byte format for sensor to LoRa communication
2/12-2/19: Byte message error handling
2/19-3/5: Voltage calculation from Arduino
3/5-3/19: Pressure sensor test for expected behavior
3/19-3/26: Sensor disconnectivity test
3/26-4/9: Wire diagram

This schedule is tentative.  A lot of the tasks can be switched around in order, as long as byte messages are handled before sensor tests 
and sensors are received before the wire diagram is made.
